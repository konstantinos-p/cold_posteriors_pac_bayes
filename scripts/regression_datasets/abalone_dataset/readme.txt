Abalone Dataset
Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements

! Note: The number of rings is equal to the age of the abalone. !

Context

The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings
through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to
predict the age. Further information, such as weather patterns and location (hence food availability) may be required
to solve the problem.
