This folder contains functions that plot the loss landscape of the Alquier bound.
The bound is plotted after all approximations have been made, and is referenced
 as \B_{approx} in the text. Furthermore either all other variables are set to the
 value of 1 or they are sampled randomly from toy distributions. In this way these plots
 are not necessarily realistic.
